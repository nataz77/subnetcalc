This is a simple subnet calculator, nothing fancy. I just needed one for my job, so I made one.

### Contributors
I will be honest most of the logic of the networking calcs is from [this website](https://www.davidc.net/sites/default/subnets/subnets.html), I just added Boostrap 5 as a frontend toolkit and fixed a bunch of old JS issues.
